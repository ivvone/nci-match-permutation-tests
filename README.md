Permutation tests were used to perform a subgroup analysis of the NCI-MATCH trial (Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice)[!https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/nci-supported/nci-match].

## Abstract
### Background
NCI-MATCH is a precision medicine basket trial designed to test the
effectiveness of treating cancers based on specific genetic changes in patientsâ€™ tumors,
regardless of cancer type. Multiple subprotocols have each tested different targeted therapies
matched to specific genetic aberrations. Most subprotocols exhibited low rates of tumor
shrinkage as evaluated across all tumor types enrolled. We hypothesized that these results may
arise because these precision cancer therapies have tumor type-specific efficacy, as is common
among other cancer therapies.

### Methods
To test the hypothesis that certain tumor types are more sensitive to specific
therapies than other tumor types, we applied permutation testing to tumor volume change and
progression-free survival data from ten published NCI-MATCH subprotocols (together n=435
patients). False discovery rate was controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
Results: Six of ten subprotocols exhibited statistically significant evidence of tumor-specific
drug sensitivity, four of which were previously considered negative based on response rate
across all tumors. This signal-finding analysis highlights potential uses of FGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibition in urothelial carcinomas with actionable FGFR aberrations, MEK inhibition in lung
cancers with BRAF non-V600E mutations, and MEK inhibition in cholangiocarcinomas with
NRAS mutations.

### Conclusions
These findings support the value of basket trials because even when precision
medicines do not have tumor-agnostic activity, basket trials can identify tumor-specific activity
for future study.
